# Context, Tone, and Intent Analysis System

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a conversational analysis system that processes text input to understand context, detect tone, classify intent, and generate appropriate responses.

## Overview

The system is designed to analyze conversations by:
1. Tracking conversation context and history
2. Detecting tone (sentiment, emotion, formality, urgency)
3. Classifying user intent
4. Generating appropriate responses

This framework can be used for enhancing chatbots, customer service applications, and any system that requires understanding of conversational nuances.

## Core Components

### Context Analysis
- Tracks multi-turn conversation history
- Extracts key topics and entities from text
- Generates context embeddings using transformer models
- Implements topic drift detection for long conversations

### Tone Detection
- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative)
- Emotion detection (joy, sadness, anger, etc.)
- Formality level assessment
- Urgency detection

### Intent Classification
- Classification across common intent categories
- Fallback detection for unclear intents
- Confidence scoring to avoid misclassification

### Response Generation
- Template-based response system
- Slot filling for personalized responses
- Variance in responses to avoid repetition

## Implementation Details

The system uses pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face for various NLP tasks:
- **Context Understanding**: Sentence transformers for generating embeddings
- **Tone Detection**: DistilBERT fine-tuned for sentiment analysis
- **Intent Classification**: Rule-based classification with provisions for model-based approaches

The code includes examples of how these components can be integrated, evaluated, and visualized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- NLTK
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for analysis and visualization)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/srikantharun/LLM_evaluation.git
cd context-tone-intent-analysis
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -q transformers datasets evaluate scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn

```

3. Download required NLTK resources:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

### Usage

The main notebook demonstrates how to:
1. Initialize the system
2. Process messages and analyze them
3. Generate appropriate responses
4. Visualize the results

Example:
```python
system = ConversationSystem()
result = system.process_message("Hi there! Can you help me with something?")
print(result["response"])
```

## Demo

The repository includes a demonstration with sample conversations showing:
- Intent classification with confidence scores
- Tone analysis over multiple turns
- Response generation based on the detected intent and tone
- Visualizations of the analysis results

## Extending the System

### Fine-tuning Models
To adapt the system for specific domains:
1. Collect domain-specific examples
2. Fine-tune the pre-trained models using the provided training code
3. Replace the default models with your fine-tuned versions

### Adding New Intents
To add new intent categories:
1. Add the new intent and associated keywords to the `intents` dictionary in `IntentClassifier`
2. Add corresponding response templates to the `response_templates` dictionary in `ResponseGenerator`
